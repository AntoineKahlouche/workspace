# This repo is your workspace now !

1. `npm i` at the root
2. install VSCode recommended extensions
3. that's it, you're good to go ! ðŸš€

**BTW** : make yourself at home, don't forget to configure your VSCode to your liking

-   Choose your keybindings `Ctrl+k Ctrl+s`

For exemple I use `keybindings.json`
